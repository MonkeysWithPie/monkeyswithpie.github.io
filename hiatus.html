        <p>hi! ...atus. <em>hiatus</em>. did you laugh?<br>
            anyway, on a more serious note, if you're seeing this, it probably means that i'm on a hiatus from the internet (mainly Discord though some other platforms may be applicable). <br>
            chances are, this isn't your fault. i've been needing a break for a while and... well, no time like the present, i suppose.</p>
        <p>you can still contact me in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>shoot me an email (monkeyswithpie@morky.dev)</li>
            <li>directly my alternate discord account (@shinedopal), preferably only if you know me well</li>
            <li>use pingcremental's built-in /feedback command</li>
        </ul>
        <p>the timer above shows <em>around</em> how much time is left until i come back. don't expect me to reappear the instant that thing hits zero, though.</p>
        <p>thanks for understanding!</p>
